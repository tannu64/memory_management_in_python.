Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a built-in garbage collector, but understanding how it works can help you write more efficient and effective programs. Here's a breakdown:

Key Concepts in Python Memory Management
Memory Allocation:

Stack Memory: Used for local variables and function calls.
Heap Memory: Used for objects and data structures. Managed by the Python memory manager.
Garbage Collection:

Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory.
When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero, it is deallocated.
The garbage collector can also identify and clean up reference cycles (e.g., objects that reference each other).
Reference Counting:

Every object in Python has a reference count.
Operations like assignment or passing an object to a function increase the count.
Deleting references or going out of scope decreases the count.
